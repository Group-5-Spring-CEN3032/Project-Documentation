# Project-Documentation
This is our project's documentation repo, the corresponding documentation website can be from [group-5-spring-cen3032.github.io/Project-Documentation/](https://group-5-spring-cen3032.github.io/Project-Documentation/)

# How to Use
This documentation site uses [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a tool that generates static documentation sites from Markdown. If you're only contributing, you do not need to install MKDocs; simply create and edit `.md` files using the editor of your choice.

If you'd like a live preview or need to be able to publish the documentation; you can run MKDocs from a terminal with python. 

You can install MKDocs using `python pip install mkdocs`.

To get a live preview use `python mkdocs serve`, and to publish directly to the web using GitHub Pages use `python mkdocs gh-deploy`.
