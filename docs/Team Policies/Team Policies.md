Every user story, the team members assigned to a specific user story are responsible for maintaining the relevant documentation pages that pertain to that user story.

Every user story that relevantly requires updating the documentation should explicilty state updating the documentation as one of the requirements.


## In-Code Documentation


## Code Etiquite
You should try to make each component modular, assembling it in a **NEW** scene (Not one of the prexisting ones) whenever possible and exporting it as a prefab. This way whenever someone begins to integrade it with the rest of the project; we can minimize same-scene editing and merge conflicts.

Your code should use tripple slash comments with XML descriptors for API documentation (Visual Studio can generate this for you).

You are also required to modify the documentation to describe how to use your new or modified feature in the [Manual](../Manual/) section.
