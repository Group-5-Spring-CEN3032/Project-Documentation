# Pausing Manager
`Pausing Manager` is our custom pausing API that enables an easy to implement pausing functionality. As this is an API, most of the technical information will be in in-code documentation. 

However, we have provided a `ToggleOnPause` helper script that you can attach to objects to make certain things appear or disapear while paused or unpaused!
